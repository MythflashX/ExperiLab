Capture The Flag
hexdump -> covert binary to hex format for readability

mktemp -d -> create a temporary directory in /tmp and print the directory name. good for experiments

base64 - encode or decode with base64 encoding (transmitting binary data over text channel)
ENCODE: echo "Hello" | base64 DECODE:  echo "SGVsbG8K" | base64 --decode

tr (translate or replace character in input)
tr -> echo "hello_world" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'

xxd - make a hexdump or do the reverse
xxd can create a hexdump from binary file or a hexdump back to binary
xxd -r -p file.extension > original [-r (rever) -p (works with plain hex dump format)] (if resulting file doesn't work) remove -p
xxd -r filename.txt > original [-r (revert)] is sufficient for most case...

file determine file type
file filename (it will tell you what type of file it is even if the file doesn't have extension type like .txt or anything)

extract bzip2 -d file.bz2
extract gzip -d file.gz
extract tar -xvf file.tar
 
 
SSH OPENSSH KEYS Private & Public Keys
Key-Based SSH Login
ssh keys too open - that is pretty neat actually...ssh won't allow your private key to connect to the server if it is read write or do whatever they want by everyone using the system(work desktops are used by multiple users with differnt accounts) so it is required to permission lock chmod 600 sshkey.private if u want to use that key to connect to the server..or else it will just ask u for extra password
 
 
SSL - Secure Socket Layer - old insecure now
TLS - Transport Layer Security - modern secure version
OpenSSL - tool/library to interact with SSL/TLS connections
SSL/TLS are used in HTTPS/FTPS/SMTPS and more
SSL/TLS -> authentication | encryption | integrity
 
 
Port Scan send client request to range of server port to find active ports
postsweep scan multiple port for specific listening port
Internet Protocol Sweep
TCP/IP 
Nmap - Map a network, find open ports, detect services, reconnaissance tool
Ncat is from Nmap suite - Swiss Army Knife for network communication
Ncat can send, receive data over TCP or UDP
Ncat work as client or server
Ncat can be used to setup backdoor, transfer files, chat, connect to port manually
Scanning TCP, SYN, UDP, ACK, etc...
nc - netcat - Swiss Army Knife for network communication
telnet - old school client -> connect to TCP ports | only works with plain connection | No SSL, No Encryption
 
SETUID & SETGID
setuid -> gives the privilege access of the owner to every user (for example root user created a file and want other user to use the program but don't want to give them the same privilege...you set uid..that way every other user can run the file with root privileges without having root access)
setgid -> same as setuid but for groups
grep -r * "term" (find term in every file in the directory and sub directory) cool_trick
